# Socket.ioDrawingTest
A small test of a real time drawing app using socket.io and p5.js. 

[Check it out deployed on Heroku here!](https://socket-io-drawing.herokuapp.com/)

To start a local server, use `npm start`, and direct your browser to `localhost:6567`. Any drawing changes will be shown to all other clients.
